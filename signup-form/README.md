## Reflection

1. Learned how to make a split 50-50 landing page. I used relative and absolute positioning to achieve this.
2. Used CSS Flexbox to align contents inside the form as well as CSS Grid to format input elements into 3 rows, 2 columns.
3. Learned how to verify and confirm password inputs using JavaScript. Specifically, I added an active class to the element containing the error message whenever passwords did not match.
