## Challenges

1. I learned tailwind and DaisyUI from scratch using their documentation. The learning curve for these frameworks was really smooth because I had a solid foundation with vanilla CSS. Would love to explore other CSS frameworks in the future such as Bootstrap or MUI which are industry standards.

2. I learned how to use Firebase authentication and storage using from their documentation. Since Firebase has recently updated to v9 this year, there weren't a lot of resources I could look into on the internet. Overall documentation was the best source of information and was able to set up the backend in less than few hours. I utilized the Context API as well for backend and frontend to interact easily.

3. React router has recently also updated to v6, and was slightly different than what I've learned, such as deprecation of `useHistory` hook or `Switch` component. Eventually had to look up documentation for this one as well and figure out the changes myself.
