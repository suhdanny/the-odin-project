# Reflection

1. I learned how to use CSS grid to make a general web-page layout. I specifically utilized `grid-template-areas` property on the grid container by referencing the names of grid areas that I defined on the grid items.
2. After using Grid to make a general layout, I used Flexbox on the grid items to accomplish layouts that I wanted. I also used relative and absolute positioning to place the down arrows on the top right corner of the container. I also learned how to use `transform` to rotate the arrows pointing upwards.
3. I learned how to use CSS and HTML SVGs to make a percentage circles. I also learned how to use `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties on SVGs.
