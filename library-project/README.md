# Library Project

This project aimed to build a simple library app where you can add the books you have read or planning to read. Created by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The app supports:

- Adding books to your library where you can record the title, author, page number and whether you finished reading your book.
- Removing books from your library.
- Changing the read status to not-read with a button click
