# Library Project

This project aimed to build a simple library app where you can add the books you have read or planning to read. Created by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The app supports:

- Adding books to your library where you can record the title, author, page number and whether you finished reading your book.
- Removing books from your library.
- Changing the read status to not-read with a button click

## Reflection

1. Used Object and Object Constructors to store user input, and manipulated the DOM to add book elements
2. Add events to buttons on each book's display where users can change their read status and also remove the book from the library
3. Created a modal which is prompted when users click the add book button, and also change the overlay accordingly when the modals open and close
