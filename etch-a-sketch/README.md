# Etch-A-Sketch

This project aimed to build an online etch-a-sketch application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can find the detailed description of the project [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

The application supports custom color-input, rainbow mode, raser and reset options as well as user-specified grid size for increasing or decreasing sketchpad resolution.
